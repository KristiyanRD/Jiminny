### Writen in python3
### Used framework for testing: PyUnit
### Used framework for automation: Selenium


## Description
#### - This is small automation test infrastructure witch is used to test the Todo App
##### - In Common folder tou can find base functionality witch used to navigate, click, enter text in some field etcâ€¦ and also browser setup(The setup is made to run for two browsers Chrome and Firefox)
##### - In Config folder browser_config.yaml we can change the main browser and url witch tests are using
##### - In TodoApp you cn find common and common_selectors witch are used to create some functionality for the specific pages. The tests are stored in folder tests and the test data used for them is stored in test_data. Screenshots folder is used to store screenshot from failed tests.
##### - In Tools are stored custom tools like yaml and text reader(email or db connection sender can be added etc...) to avoid duplicating the code in the tests
## Steps to run the tests:
##### Install python3: https://www.python.org/
##### Install PyCharm Community Edition IDE: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
##### - Open the project in PyCharm
##### - The ide should detect the missing packages and will ask you to add them
###### --> if not, you can use python interpreter and add them manually from File>Settings>PythonInterpreter
###### --> if not, you can use the terminal: pip install <name_of_the_package>
###### --> all needed packages are on the picture below.

##### - You should be able to run the test when simply pre mouse right click and Run

##### - Or you can enter command into the terminal: python <file_path>
###### --> NOTE: running the test from the terminal cause issue with the import for some reason, and you may not be able to run the test so i suggest using the firs approach!
